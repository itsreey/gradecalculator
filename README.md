# UON GPA Calculator App
A GPA calculator made in .NET MAUI, for [UON's](https://www.newcastle.edu.au/) INFT2051 Mobile App Development class.

Meant to make life easier for UON students, just add your course + letter grade received to a list and the app will calculate your overall GPA and let you know your result.

Rather rushed and unpolished. The main function is there and I'm pleased I got a light/dark mode toggle working, but it could be much better. Still, I'm leaving it up and public for posterity :)
