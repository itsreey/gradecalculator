To-Do:

* Profiles to save lists of courses? Let user create a profile with a nickname, program name, and profile picture
* [DONE] Haptic feedback when results are shown, just to have more features haha.
* Maybe have a setting to be able to toggle extra features off if it's distracting
* Include SVG icons for buttons like edit, delete, calculate. For pizzazz. Consider flaticon or tabler.io for that

WHAT IF, the whole background colour of the app changes according to the results, similar to how Weight Tracker does?
