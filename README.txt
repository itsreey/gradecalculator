To-Do:

* Profiles to save lists of courses? Let user create a profile with a nickname, program name, and profile picture
* [DONE] Haptic feedback when results are shown, just to have more features haha.
* Maybe have a setting to be able to toggle extra features off if it's distracting
* [DONE] Include SVG icons for buttons like edit, delete, calculate. For pizzazz. Consider flaticon or tabler.io for that
* Dark mode/Light mode toggle in settings, similar to Profitocracy (see https://github.com/KrawMire/profitocracy)

WHAT IF, the whole background colour of the app changes according to the results, similar to how Weight Tracker does?
