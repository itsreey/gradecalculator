To-Do:

* Profiles to save lists of courses? Let user create a profile with a nickname, program name, and profile picture. This will take care of the camera feature
* Add notifications?? Notifications for what though
* [DONE] Haptic feedback when results are shown, just to have more features haha.
* [DONE] Include SVG icons for buttons like edit, delete, calculate. For pizzazz. Consider flaticon or tabler.io for that
* [DONE] Dark mode/Light mode toggle in settings,
